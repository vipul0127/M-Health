## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Django 3.x or later
- MySQL or SQLite for database
- Required Libraries: `numpy`, `matplotlib`, `pandas`, etc.

---

## Installation and Setup

Follow the instructions provided earlier for **cloning the repository**, **installing dependencies**, **setting up the database**, and running the development server.

---

By integrating the **Home Page** as a starting point after login, it serves as a hub for users to access various functionalities like uploading files, viewing data, and downloading HL7-formatted reports. This updated structure enhances usability and ensures a streamlined user experience.

### Step 1: Clone the Repository

Clone the repository to your local machine:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/mhealth-django.git
cd mhealth-django
```

### Step 2: Install Dependencies

Create a virtual environment and install required dependencies:
```bash
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Step 3: Set Up the Database

Create a database in MySQL or use the default SQLite database.
Update the database settings in `settings.py`:
```python
DATABASES = {
    'default': {
        'ENGINE': 'django.db.backends.mysql',  # Or 'sqlite3' for SQLite
        'NAME': 'mhealth_db',
        'USER': 'your-database-user',
        'PASSWORD': 'your-database-password',
        'HOST': 'localhost',
        'PORT': '3306',
    }
}
```

### Step 4: Migrate the Database

Run the database migrations to create tables:
```bash
python manage.py migrate
```

### Step 5: Create a Superuser

Create a superuser to access the Django admin interface:
```bash
python manage.py createsuperuser
```

### Step 6: Run the Development Server

Start the server:
```bash
python manage.py runserver
```

## Django Project Structure

Here‚Äôs an overview of the key Django files:

- **urls.py**: URL routing for the project.
  - Defines the URL patterns for the different views like login, consent form, file uploads, etc.

- **views.py**: Contains the logic for handling the HTTP requests.
  - Views for handling user authentication, consent form, file upload, etc.

- **models.py**: Defines the data models for users, files, and consent forms.

- **admin.py**: Registers models with the Django admin interface for easy management.

- **settings.py**: Contains the configuration for the Django project, including database settings and middleware.

- **manage.py**: Django's command-line utility for managing various administrative tasks (e.g., running the server, migrating the database).

## Code Snippets

Here‚Äôs an example of a database setup and running the server:

1. **Set up a database for user authentication and file uploads**:

   In `settings.py`:
   ```python
   DATABASES = {
       'default': {
           'ENGINE': 'django.db.backends.mysql',  # Or 'sqlite3' for SQLite
           'NAME': 'mhealth_db',
           'USER': 'your-database-user',
           'PASSWORD': 'your-database-password',
           'HOST': 'localhost',
           'PORT': '3306',
       }
   }
   ```

2. **Configure the Django server and connect to the database**:
   
   Ensure your database settings in `settings.py` match your database configuration. Then run migrations to create the necessary tables.

3. **Run the server**:

   For **Django**:
   ```bash
   python manage.py runserver
   ```

This update integrates the analysis of PPG data during various times and activities, as well as the conversion of the measured parameters into HL7 format for medical data exchange.
